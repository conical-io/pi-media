  <p>Pi-Media is a little project designed to control what is displayed on TVs and screens in a conference center environment. The project has the following dependencies: 
    <ul>
      <li>A Spotify Premium account</li>
      <li>A Dropbox account</li>
      <li>Raspberry Pi with Mopidy and FBI installed</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>The project uses "profiles" which can be scheduled to play at different times during the week. Each profile has a Spotify playlist attached to it, as well as reading images from a directory in your Dropbox account.</p>
  <p>Pi-Media is designed to be incredibly simple, and reduce time spent faffing about in yet another priece of software, hence the third party integration. To changes screens and music, one has to simply update Dropbox and Spotify, rather than returning here to upload images/tracks etc. All that is done here is linking to the Dropbox and Spotify accounts, creating the profiles, and setting the schedule.</p>
